            <h2>The Wheelbarrow: &nbsp; First Century BCE</h2>
            <p>
                It is very surprising that wheelbarrows did not exist in Western civilization until the eleventh or twelfth century CE. 
                Evidence suggests that the wheelbarrow was invented south-western China in the first century BCE, but may have existed before 
                that. Wheelbarrows are a simple, yet very effective tool that can dramatically cut down the labor needed for any building project. 
                But their use in China wasn’t limited to building: they were also an important tool in war and could be given sails to achieve speeds 
                of up to 40 miles per hour.

            <h2>Biological Pest Control: &nbsp; Third Century CE</h2>
            <p>
                Biological pest control (using one insect to kill another) has been practiced in China for 1700 years and can be 
                used for the protection of crops. Mandrin oranges are victim to attack from black ants, caterpillars, and other bugs 
                which prevent their ability to grow. The Chinese were able to combat this issue through the use of weaver ants. These 
                ants don’t eat the fruit, but rather the insects attempting to eat the mandrin orange. The Chinese would place stretches 
                of bamboo between the orange trees to allow the ants to travel freely. Biological pest control was essential, especially
                in southern China as an entire crop could be damaged without weaver ants.

            <h2>Printing: &nbsp; Eighth and Eleventh Centuries CE</h2>
            <p >
                Printing has been around in China since the eighth century CE, but many proto-printing techniques were used before that, 
                some of which originated in the Middle East. This includes the use of stamp seals to print names, making inscriptions on stone 
                tablets, and using stencils and composite ink squeezes (dotted paper was pressed on top of a blank sheet and ink was applied to 
                the back, where a sentisled design emerged). The earliest text using standard printing techniques was a Buddhist charm scroll that 
                was printed sometime between 704 and 751 CE. The first complete book ‘Diamond Sutra’ was printed in 764 AD. Printing would see 
                dramatic improvement in a short period of time, and by the tenth century, the Chinese could print hundreds of thousands or even 
                millions of copies.
