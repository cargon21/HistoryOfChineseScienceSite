        <h1>The History of Science in China</h1>
        <h2>A Closer Look at the Discoveries of Traditional China</p>

    <p class = "introduction">
        China has been the source of many inventions and discoveries that have significantly impacted modern society. It may come as a surprise 
        to many that the inventions and scientific discoveries that emerged in China wouldn’t be discovered or utilized by the rest of the world 
        for thousands of years. Nearly every aspect of life is affected by science and technology and modern society has been greatly impacted 
        by the brilliance of ancient Chinese discoveries.

        This website is a part of a Suffolk University Honors Program assignment. This simple document contains information about the scientific 
        advancements and discoveries made in traditional China. It serves as just a small contribution to the vast history knowledge we have of the 
        world around us. All findings come from Robert Temples’s 'The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention.' I would like 
        to thank Professor Robert Hannigan from the Suffolk University History Department for his guidance and support throughout this semester.
